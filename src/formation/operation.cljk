  "OperationActor -- one tool-fleet operation = one supervised actor run,
  expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor (ToolFleet-LLM) is
  sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed
  through the ToolFleetGovernor (:govern) and the rollout phase gate
  (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam) - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)                                       - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                                          - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one tool-fleet operation (intake -> advise -> govern ->
  decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop -- each
  operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human operator (the site tech / safety reviewer). The
  approver resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected).
  :fleet/enroll / :fleet/return-to-service / :fleet/retire / :rental/checkout
  ALWAYS reach this node when the governor is clean -- see formation.phase."
